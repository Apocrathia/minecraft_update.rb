minecraft_update.rb
===================

A Ruby script for updating CraftBukkit and Spigot servers.

Note: This script was written using Ruby 2.1.0. Some things may not work with previous versions of Ruby.

It is assumed that the Minecraft server has already been halted. If you try to run this before stopping the server, bad things may happen.

I intended this script for use in McMyAdmin environments on Linux where this script would be called from mcma's scheduler, after mcma had already stopped the server.

Please feel free to give any suggestions, comments, hatemail, etc... as this is my first Ruby project, and I mainly wrote this as an exercise in learning the language.
